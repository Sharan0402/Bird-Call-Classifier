This project involved developing a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow to classify rainforest bird calls from audio recordings. 
The model was trained on curated datasets to identify capuchin calls with high accuracy. An audio preprocessing pipeline was built using tools like librosa and TensorFlow I/O to handle diverse audio file formats and convert them to spectrograms for model input. 
The characteristics of capuchin calls were analyzed using NumPy and TensorFlow to configure optimal audio slicing and model architecture. The model was applied to multiple long rainforest recordings to predict bird call counts per file. The results were exported using CSV to share insights into bird density in different areas of the rainforest.
